- Same interface, different behavior
- Interface to a particular resource, the resource may require special set up
- Difference between Proxy and Decorator:
    - Proxy tries to make an identical interface, decorator provides an enhanced interface
    - Decorator usually has a pointer to the underlying struct it is decorating, Proxy doesn't have to
    - A Proxy may be working with an uninitialized struct
